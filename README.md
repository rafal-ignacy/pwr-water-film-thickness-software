# Water film thickness measurement software

Developed software controls an optical device setup for measuring the thickness of a thin layer of water (up to 0.4 mm) was implemented. The main goal is to control the Thorlabs laboratory platform and take spectral measurments from the spectrometer. The obtained values are analyzed to determine the final dimension. 

The application was developed as part of the master's thesis at the **Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology**.
  
Details were described within PDF file which contains master's thesis content (Polish language).
